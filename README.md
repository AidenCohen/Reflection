I learned a lot about code throughout the summer, I got better through practice and really honed my coding skills. Before taking this clas, I felt that I was an okay coder, and that I needed to do a lot of work to really master it. However, through this class I learned that I was a good coder, and the only thing that really matters is having the right mindset towards coding. This class helped me practice my coding to a point where I was vastly improving.

Today, I did npcs, and finished the jumping bug. I made the npc talk to the player, and i'm currently making the enemy, all that is a work in progress. tomorrow, I am going to fix up advanced enemy AI and an inventory which you can store weapons in. I also hope to make the entire game scroll, so that I can add more things to it. I hope to finish my game, and maybe even continue it in the future.

Today I did all of the Intro, and figured out a story for my game. It is about a block knight and his quest to become an offical knight in the kingdom. Now I have to work on the menu, and actual components of the game. I am about to do NPCs and Player movement, and inventor and enemy placement next. I hope i get a lot of work done tonight.

Today I debugged a program, this was the wifi guesssing program that did not work. After i got a jist of what it was doing, i tried turning networks on and off, and tried to decorrupt the network by removing it from my system then readding it, and trying to identify problems in the code. Eventually it turned out that my wifi card was too slow and needed at least 2.5s to operate.

Today, I got a new project, to make a doorbell out of scannning a QR code. I didn't do too much with it, but got started with writing an app in python about it. It seems like a cool project that I can handle, and I hope I can finish it before I leave. I also am getting started with the network project. It seems cool because I haven't done anything like it before, and I would like to experience hacking into it.

Today we did a dot project. I got it done after 3 iterations of code, so i'm happy. I solved it by using loops and lists. However, i'm sad that I also did not get pizza due to the fact that my classmates didn't solve it. However, I hope that more challenges will come my way. I was also introduced to a palindrome project that I hope to finish later.

Today we learned about dictionaries and 2d and 3d lists. A dictionary is a randomly accessed index with no order, while a list is organized. I also went and completed the first 2 challenges of horizontal scrolling and pictures in pokemon. Now I will go on to the 3rd challenge making it scroll 2x faster when the space bar is pressed.

Today, I learned what a list is in python. We talked about how they were a lot like arraylists in java, where you can add and subtract things from a list kind of like an arraylist. I also learned a lot about for in loops, and how they can apply to scrolling text. A for in loop prints everything within a range. I hope that we continue learning at this pace, and I hope that I will succed in achieveing horizontal scrolling text.

Today I edited my website again, this time focusing less on the gold plating, and more on the content. I learned some new things in css when trying to stream line my animation, and more about transitions when trying to create a new one. I also added some words, and pictures onto my home and about pages, and go the nav bar to work. I mainly improved and added more stable structure. In the future, I hope to add more content, and hope to have fun while adding more to my website.

Today I edited my website, added alot of Css and js, and experimented with Animations, I spent most of class trying to use js or css to do so, but eventually, I did not make it anywhere, and am trying very hard to put it in somewhere. We also experimented with bootstrap, and made our website look 10x nicer with a template. Right now i am just trying to add more content to my website.

Today, I learned some more html, and refreshed my memory on how it worked. We created a basic website, and customized it to our needs. We also looked at using our git domain to act as a server for our website. Today was fun, inquisitive and engaging, things that I really enjoy about this class.

Today, I learned a lot about git and command prompt, we learned some basic commands which we can do to commit, edit , and change git files on both the database and the hard copy. this week however, we learned a lot about computer parts and how they worked as an introduction to programming. we learned binary, how ram and the processor worked, the p vs np problem, and much more. I think this week was productive as an introduction to computing, and I hope that we continue such productivity.
