Today we did a dot project. I got it done after 3 iterations of code, so i'm happy. I solved it by using loops and lists. However, i'm sad that I also did not get pizza due to the fact that my classmates didn't solve it. However, I hope that more challenges will come my way. I was also introduced to a palindrome project that I hope to finish later.

Today we learned about dictionaries and 2d and 3d lists. A dictionary is a randomly accessed index with no order, while a list is organized. I also went and completed the first 2 challenges of horizontal scrolling and pictures in pokemon. Now I will go on to the 3rd challenge making it scroll 2x faster when the space bar is pressed.

Today, I learned what a list is in python. We talked about how they were a lot like arraylists in java, where you can add and subtract things from a list kind of like an arraylist. I also learned a lot about for in loops, and how they can apply to scrolling text. A for in loop prints everything within a range. I hope that we continue learning at this pace, and I hope that I will succed in achieveing horizontal scrolling text.

Today I edited my website again, this time focusing less on the gold plating, and more on the content. I learned some new things in css when trying to stream line my animation, and more about transitions when trying to create a new one. I also added some words, and pictures onto my home and about pages, and go the nav bar to work. I mainly improved and added more stable structure. In the future, I hope to add more content, and hope to have fun while adding more to my website.

Today I edited my website, added alot of Css and js, and experimented with Animations, I spent most of class trying to use js or css to do so, but eventually, I did not make it anywhere, and am trying very hard to put it in somewhere. We also experimented with bootstrap, and made our website look 10x nicer with a template. Right now i am just trying to add more content to my website.

Today, I learned a lot about git and command prompt, we learned some basic commands which we can do to commit, edit , and change git files on both the database and the hard copy. this week however, we learned a lot about computer parts and how they worked as an introduction to programming. we learned binary, how ram and the processor worked, the p vs np problem, and much more. I think this week was productive as an introduction to computing, and I hope that we continue such productivity.
