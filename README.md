Today, I learned some more html, and refreshed my memory on how it worked. We created a basic website, and customized it to our needs. We also looked at using our git domain to act as a server for our website. Today was fun, inquisitive and engaging, things that I really enjoy about this class.

Today, I learned a lot about git and command prompt, we learned some basic commands which we can do to commit, edit , and change git files on both the database and the hard copy. this week however, we learned a lot about computer parts and how they worked as an introduction to programming. we learned binary, how ram and the processor worked, the p vs np problem, and much more. I think this week was productive as an introduction to computing, and I hope that we continue such productivity.
