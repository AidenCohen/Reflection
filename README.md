Today, I learned a lot about git and command prompt, we learned some basic commands which we can do to commit, edit , and change git files on both the database and the hard copy. this week however, we learned a lot about computer parts and how they worked as an introduction to programming. we learned binary, how ram and the processor worked, the p vs np problem, and much more. I think this week was productive as an introduction to computing, and I hope that we continue such productivity.
