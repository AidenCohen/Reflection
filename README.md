Today I edited my website again, this time focusing less on the gold plating, and more on the content. I learned some new things in css when trying to stream line my animation, and more about transitions when trying to create a new one. I also added some words, and pictures onto my home and about pages, and go the nav bar to work. I mainly improved and added more stable structure. In the future, I hope to add more content, and hope to have fun while adding more to my website.

Today I edited my website, added alot of Css and js, and experimented with Animations, I spent most of class trying to use js or css to do so, but eventually, I did not make it anywhere, and am trying very hard to put it in somewhere. We also experimented with bootstrap, and made our website look 10x nicer with a template. Right now i am just trying to add more content to my website.

Today, I learned some more html, and refreshed my memory on how it worked. We created a basic website, and customized it to our needs. We also looked at using our git domain to act as a server for our website. Today was fun, inquisitive and engaging, things that I really enjoy about this class.

Today, I learned a lot about git and command prompt, we learned some basic commands which we can do to commit, edit , and change git files on both the database and the hard copy. this week however, we learned a lot about computer parts and how they worked as an introduction to programming. we learned binary, how ram and the processor worked, the p vs np problem, and much more. I think this week was productive as an introduction to computing, and I hope that we continue such productivity.
